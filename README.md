# RSA_Algorithm
## RSA implementation with a demo driver for proof of concept

Current settings (these can be modified in the code as needed)
 * p and q are atleast 1536 bits
 * difference of p and q is larger than 2^1000
 * public key (e) = 65537
 
Note: this is not a secure implementation. I wrote this code created for educational purposes.
